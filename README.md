angular/test3 
This is the front end of the website found at jonathancarndt.com
The front end uses angular materials framework
each project uses webGL
Each subproject angular/dragon and angular/serpinski and more to come is a seperate webpage that is shown in the main page each in a card in an iframe.

Ignore everything not in the angular directory.  Those were the initial commit and for a history, i've decided to keep it.
