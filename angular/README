To run the 3dmaze project, a server must be started.  I've created a small script to start a server.
The script must be run from the directory at the same level as the folders, not inside the folders.
The script runs this command so you may just run it yourself from that location:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Obviously python must be installed on your machine, otherwise i suggest you run it from your own
server or just view it on my website at:

http://jonathancarndt.com


Then if you've chosen to run it locally using the python command above the go to the follow link
in your browser:

http://localhost:8000/3dmaze/

This will serve the html file from the 3dmaze directory and allow access the the commons folder one
directory back.

Just to clarify the structure must be

3dmaze/
   index.html
   maze.js
   script.js
   resources/
      ceiling.png
      cubetexture.png
      tile.jpg
common/
   basics.js
   configWebgl.js
   cube.js
   glMatrix-0.9.5.min.js
   glUtils.js
   initializeWebGL.js
   initShaders.js
   keyinput.js
   logic.js
   MV.js
   sylvester.js
   webgl-utils.js

runMe.sh

notice the runMe.sh is just outside the two folders, this is by design and where the program should be run
like the following:

./runMe.sh
